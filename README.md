# TQWT for Edge Impulse üß†‚ö°

**High-performance feature extraction for TinyML using the Tunable Q-Factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT) within Edge Impulse.**

This repository provides a custom processing block that allows you to use TQWT for advanced feature engineering, unlocking new levels of accuracy for signal classification on microcontrollers.

## üéØ Project Overview

Standard feature extraction methods like FFT are powerful but can struggle with signals that are **oscillatory and non-stationary** (e.g., biomedical signals like ECG/EEG or machine vibration data). The **Tunable Q-Factor Wavelet Transform (TQWT)** is specifically designed to analyze such signals by decomposing them into sub-bands with tunable oscillatory behavior.

By integrating TQWT into an **Edge Impulse** pipeline, we can build highly efficient and accurate machine learning models that run directly on edge devices. This project makes that integration seamless.

* **Custom TQWT Processing Block:** Easily add TQWT feature extraction to any Edge Impulse project.
* **Tunable Parameters:** Configure the Q-factor, redundancy, and number of sub-bands to perfectly match your signal's characteristics.
* **Improved Accuracy:** Extract more meaningful features from complex signals, leading to better model performance.
* **Efficient Implementation:** Optimized for deployment on resource-constrained microcontrollers.
* **Example Projects:** Includes sample datasets and impulse projects (e.g., ECG arrhythmia detection, bearing fault analysis) to get you started.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Data Ingestion:** Collect raw time-series data using the Edge Impulse CLI or Studio.
2.  **Custom Processing Block:** Our custom block ingests the raw signal data.
3.  **TQWT Feature Extraction:** The block applies the TQWT algorithm, decomposing the signal. It then calculates statistics (e.g., energy, entropy) from the resulting sub-bands to create a feature vector.
4.  **Model Training:** This feature vector is fed into a neural network or other classifier within Edge Impulse for training.
5.  **Deployment:** The entire pipeline, including the TQWT block and the trained model, is compiled into an efficient library for deployment on your target device.
